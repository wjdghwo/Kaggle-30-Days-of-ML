# Kaggle-30-Days-of-ML

I received an e-mail from Kaggle asking me to participate in '30 Days of ML'.
I participated in the course to review and organize the machine learning skills and Python grammar that I have learned so far.


In the first 2 weeks, I received hands-on assignments delivered to my inbox. The goal of these assignments is to rapidly cover the most essential skills needed to get your hands dirty with data. I started by learning how to code in Python and quickly learn how to build my first machine learning model.
